Allows for plugin installation simply by submitting the wordpress plugin name or URL. Also includes a bookmarklet.

== Description ==

This plugin is an improvement to the current Wordpress plugin installation methods. It allows you to install one or more plugins simply by typing their names or download URLs in a textarea.

This means you can install all your favorite wordpress plugins in one go!

Furthermore, a bookmarklet is included which lets you install plugins directly from an external plugin download page. (See screenshots tab)

**Example**

The installation form will happily accept any of these inputs: 

* WP DB Backup
* http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-db-backup/
* http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wp-db-backup.2.2.2.zip 

Plugins don't need to be hosted at Wordpress.org. As long as you use the direct download URL, third party plugins will install without a hitch:

* http://www.feedburner.com/fb/products/feedburner_feedsmith_plugin_2.3.zip
